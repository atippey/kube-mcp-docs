# kubemcp.io

> Kubernetes-native operator for running Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers as first-class cluster resources. Define MCP tools, prompts, and resources with CRDs; the operator manages Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, NetworkPolicies, and Ingress automatically.

kubemcp.io ships four CRDs: `MCPServer` (the server deployment), `MCPTool` (a callable tool backed by an HTTP service), `MCPPrompt` (a reusable prompt template), and `MCPResource` (a readable data resource). Tools, prompts, and resources are selected into a server by label using `spec.toolSelector`.

## Getting Started

- [Installation](https://kubemcp.io/getting-started/installation/): Install CRDs and deploy the operator with Kustomize.
- [Quickstart](https://kubemcp.io/getting-started/quickstart/): Deploy a working MCP server with tools, prompts, and resources in minutes.
- [Concepts](https://kubemcp.io/getting-started/concepts/): Core architecture and reconciliation model.

## Guides

- [Creating Tools](https://kubemcp.io/guides/creating-tools/): Build a backing service and register it with MCPTool.
- [Multi Tool](https://kubemcp.io/guides/multi-tool/): Expose multiple endpoints from one MCPTool using spec.tools[].
- [Prompts and Resources](https://kubemcp.io/guides/prompts-resources/): Add reusable prompt templates and API resources.
- [Networking](https://kubemcp.io/guides/networking/): Secure traffic with NetworkPolicy and namespace boundaries.
- [Observability](https://kubemcp.io/guides/observability/): Monitor MCP workloads with metrics, logs, health checks, and status conditions.
