## Core resources

- `MCPServer`: top-level server deployment and selection boundary.
- `MCPTool`: executable tool definitions mapped to backing services.
- `MCPPrompt`: reusable template prompts with variables.
- `MCPResource`: API-style resources, operation mappings, or inline content.

## Label selectors

`MCPServer.spec.toolSelector` controls which resources are attached to a server.

- Use `matchLabels` for stable grouping (`mcp-server: main`).
- Use `matchExpressions` for dynamic policies across teams.

## Reconciliation loop

The operator continuously ensures actual cluster state matches desired state.

- Watches CRD resources.
- Materializes deployment/service/ingress/config artifacts.
- Updates status fields and conditions.

## Runtime composition

Multiple tools, prompts, and resources can be composed behind one `MCPServer` endpoint surface. See [Multi Tool Guide](/guides/multi-tool/).
