## Status conditions

Each MCPServer exposes a `status.conditions` array that reflects the outcome of the last reconciliation. Use conditions as the first step when diagnosing issues.

```bash
kubectl describe mcpserver <name> -n <namespace>
```

### MCPServer conditions

| Condition | Status `True` means… | Status `False` means… | What to check |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ToolsDiscovered` | At least one MCPTool, MCPPrompt, or MCPResource matched `toolSelector` | No resources matched | Verify labels on MCPTool/Prompt/Resource match the MCPServer's `toolSelector` |
| `ConfigReady` | ConfigMap written successfully with all tool/prompt/resource config | _(not set — reconciliation raises before writing False; check for a missing condition)_ | Check operator logs if this condition is absent or stale |
| `Ready` | Deployment has at least one ready replica | No replicas ready | Check pod events and image pull errors |

Example output showing a healthy server:

```
Status:
  Ready Replicas:  1
  Tool Count:      2
  Prompt Count:    2
  Resource Count:  2
  Conditions:
    Type:    ToolsDiscovered
    Status:  True
    Reason:  ResourcesFound
    Message: Found 2 tool(s), 2 prompt(s), 2 resource(s) matching selector ...
    Type:    ConfigReady
    Status:  True
    Reason:  ConfigMapCreated
    Message: ConfigMap created with 2 tool(s), 2 prompt(s), 2 resource(s)
    Type:    Ready
    Status:  True
    Reason:  DeploymentReady
    Message: Deployment has 1 ready replica(s)
```

### Child resource conditions

MCPTool, MCPPrompt, and MCPResource each carry their own `status.conditions`. When any child resource changes, the operator re-reconciles **all MCPServers in the same namespace** (not just those whose `toolSelector` matches).

#### MCPTool — condition type `Ready`

| Reason | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ServiceResolved` | True | Service found; `status.resolvedEndpoint` contains the full URL |
| `ServiceNotFound` | False | Named Service does not exist in the namespace |

#### MCPPrompt — condition type `Validated`

| Reason | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TemplateValid` | True | All `{{variable}}` placeholders are declared in `spec.variables` |
| `UndeclaredVariables` | False | Template uses variables not listed in `spec.variables` |
| `UnusedVariables` | False | `spec.variables` declares names not referenced in the template |

#### MCPResource — condition type `Ready`

| Reason | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ContentValid` | True | Inline `spec.content` validated successfully |
| `OperationsValid` | True | All `spec.operations` validated and service endpoints resolved |
| `InvalidSpec` | False | Neither `spec.operations` nor `spec.content` is defined |
| `EmptyContent` | False | `spec.content` has neither `text` nor `blob` |
| `ServiceNotFound` | False | A Service referenced in `spec.operations` does not exist |

## Metrics

Expose Prometheus-compatible metrics for operator and server workloads.

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n mcp-system deploy/mcp-operator 9090:9090
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

## Logging

Use structured JSON logs and centralize with your platform logging stack.

```bash
kubectl logs -n mcp-system deploy/mcp-operator -f
```

## Health endpoints

Ensure readiness and liveness probes are enabled in your deployment specs.

```bash
kubectl describe mcpserver main -n mcp-system
```
