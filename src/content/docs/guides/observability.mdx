## Metrics

Expose Prometheus-compatible metrics for operator and server workloads.

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n mcp-system deploy/mcp-operator 9090:9090
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

## Logging

Use structured JSON logs and centralize with your platform logging stack.

```bash
kubectl logs -n mcp-system deploy/mcp-operator -f
```

## Health endpoints

Ensure readiness and liveness probes are enabled in your deployment specs.

Use resource status and conditions for quick diagnostics:

```bash
kubectl describe mcpserver main -n mcp-system
```
